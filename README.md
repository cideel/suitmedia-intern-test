Name :  Anggito Setoadji



This is a Flutter application that demonstrates basic state management using GetX and dynamic user data fetching from an API. The app consists of three screens:

1. **First Screen**: Allows the user to input a name and a sentence to check if it is a palindrome.
2. **Second Screen**: Displays a welcome message along with the entered name and a selected user name.
3. **Third Screen**: Fetches and displays a list of users from an API, allowing the user to select one, which updates the second screen.

## Features

- **Palindrome Checker**: Input a sentence, and the app will check if it is a palindrome.
- **Dynamic User Data**: Fetch user data from an API and display it in a list.
- **Responsive UI**: The app is built with responsiveness in mind, using `flutter_screenutil`.
- **State Management**: Uses GetX for managing state and routing between screens.
